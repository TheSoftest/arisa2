### To acquire a *bot token* from Discord:

1. Go to the [Discord developer portal][2.1] and **create a new application**.
2. Inside the **settings** for the new app, select the **Bot** section and click
**Add bot**. This will convert the app to a "bot user" so that can join servers.
3. Click the button to **copy** the bot token, then paste into the config file.

### To acquire a *personal access token* from GitHub:

1. Go to your [GitHub settings][2.2].
2. Click **Developer settings**, then select **Personal access tokens**.
3. Click **Generate new token**. You will probably have to enter your password to continue.
4. Write a useful note to help remind yourself of the purpose for the new token (for example, "arisa").
5. Click **Generate token** at the bottom. Don't select any of the scopes, we don't need those.
3. Click the button to **copy** the newly-generated token, then paste into the config file.

# For the bot to work properly, all the specified settings here must be 
# filled in, either with default settings, or by values provided by you,
# or defined in environment vars (which will overwrite those here).
#
# If you use environment vars, they have to be named in this format:
#       SECTIONNAME_OPTION_NAME
#
# For example:
#       [DISCORD]
#       BOT_TOKEN=...
# can be overwritten by the following key in the environment:
#       DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
#
#
# To use this file, copy values from DEFAULT.ini and modify accordingly.

# SECRET can be personal access token, or password (not recommended).
# This is supplied as the "password" arg over HTTP Basic Auth to raise the
# rate-limit on the GitHub API when updating King's Raid EN translation data.
# The access token does not need any access permissions at all.
